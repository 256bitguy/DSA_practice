A stack is a fundamental data structure in computer science and programming. In C++, you can use the std::stack class template from the Standard Template Library (STL) to work with stacks. Here are some common functions and methods related to the std::stack:

push(value): Pushes an element onto the top of the stack.

cpp
Copy code
std::stack<int> myStack;
myStack.push(42);
pop(): Removes the top element from the stack.

cpp
Copy code
myStack.pop();
top(): Returns a reference to the top element on the stack without removing it.

cpp
Copy code
int topElement = myStack.top();
empty(): Checks if the stack is empty and returns a Boolean value.

cpp
Copy code
if (myStack.empty()) {
    // Stack is empty
}
size(): Returns the number of elements in the stack.

cpp
Copy code
int stackSize = myStack.size();
swap(otherStack): Swaps the contents of two stacks.

cpp
Copy code
std::stack<int> anotherStack;
myStack.swap(anotherStack);
emplace(args...): Constructs an element in-place at the top of the stack.

cpp
Copy code
myStack.emplace(10, 'A');
std::stack Constructors: The std::stack class has various constructors, including those that accept containers, allocators, or other stacks as arguments.

cpp
Copy code
std::stack<int> myStack; // Default constructor
std::stack<int> myStack2(myStack); // Copy constructor
Iterating Over a Stack: You can't directly iterate over a stack using iterators, but you can pop elements while the stack is not empty.

cpp
Copy code
while (!myStack.empty()) {
    int element = myStack.top();
    // Do something with element
    myStack.pop();
}
These are some of the most commonly used functions and methods related to the std::stack container in C++. The stack is a last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure, which means that the last element pushed onto the stack is the first one to be removed.
