In C++, a std::forward_list (short for "forward singly-linked list") is a container 
class provided by the Standard Template Library (STL) that represents a 
singly-linked list. 
Unlike the standard 
std::list, which is a doubly-linked list, a std::forward_list stores a 
linear sequence of elements where each element points to the next element 
in the list.

Key characteristics and features of std::forward_list include:

Singly-Linked Structure: Each element (node) in a std::forward_list contains 
a value and a pointer/reference to the next element in the list. There is no
 pointer/reference to the previous element, which makes it more memory-efficient 
 than a doubly-linked list.

Efficiency: std::forward_list is generally more memory-efficient and has faster 
insertion and deletion operations compared to std::list. However, it has slower 
access times because you can only traverse it in one direction (forward).

Iterators: std::forward_list provides forward iterators, allowing you to traverse
 the list from the beginning to the end. It does not support bidirectional iterators 
 (i.e., you cannot iterate backward).

Insertion and Deletion: Insertion and deletion of elements at the beginning of the 
list are very efficient (constant time). You can also insert and remove elements
 after a specific element with good performance. 
However, inserting or deleting elements at the end or in the middle of the list can
 be less efficient.

No size() Member Function: Unlike some other container classes, std::forward_list
 does not provide a size() member function to directly query the number of elements. 
 You need to traverse the list to count the elements if required.

Usage: std::forward_list is suitable for situations where you need efficient 
insertions and deletions at the beginning or after a specific element and do not
 need to access elements in reverse order. It is commonly used in certain algorithms
  and data structures.
